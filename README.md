3 observations from WeatherPy

1)  There is a statistical correlation between Max temp and latitude for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
2) The Northern hemisphere's temperature is negatively correlated to the latitude, meaning that the higher the latitude, the lower the max temperature gets. On the other hand, the Southern hemisphere has a positive correlation to latitude. As the latitude of southern hemisphere cities rises, the warmer the max temperature. This can conclude that the closer a city is to the equator (latitude 0), the warmer it is.
3) No other weather attribute measured in this study is statisitically correlated to latitude. So regardless of what the latitude of the city is, it did not statistically affect the wind speed, cloudiness, or humidity. These factors are likely affected by other elements of the city (possibly elevation, terrain, etc.), which would need further research.
